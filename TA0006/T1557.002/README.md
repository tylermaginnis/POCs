# ARP Spoofing Demonstration Script

## Overview

The ARP Spoofing Demonstration Script showcases ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing by manipulating ARP messages within a controlled local network environment. It is designed to provide insight into ARP spoofing and its potential impact on network security. Please use this script responsibly and in an ethical manner.

## Demonstration

1. Run the script to observe ARP spoofing in action.
   
   - The script manipulates ARP messages to simulate ARP spoofing.
   
   - Observe how ARP responses are falsified to redirect network traffic to a different device, simulating a potential attack scenario.

   ```shell
   go run main.go
   ```

## Functionality

- Simulates ARP spoofing by manipulating ARP messages in a controlled environment.
  
- Falsifies ARP responses to make other devices on the network believe that the attacker's MAC address corresponds to a specific IP address, thereby diverting network traffic.
  
- Highlights the potential risks associated with ARP spoofing, including eavesdropping on network communications and enabling Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
  
- Serves as an educational tool for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to better understand ARP security and implement measures to prevent ARP spoofing attacks.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Ethical Use:** ARP spoofing is a cybersecurity attack that can have severe consequences when used maliciously. Always ensure that you have explicit permission to conduct ARP spoofing tests on a network.

- **Legal Compliance:** Unauthorized ARP spoofing is illegal in many jurisdictions. Be aware of and comply with local and national laws and regulations related to network security and hacking.

- **Network Security:** To defend against ARP spoofing attacks, implement security measures such as ARP spoofing detection tools, network segmentation, and secure communication protocols.

- **Education:** This script is intended for educational purposes to raise awareness about ARP spoofing vulnerabilities. It should not be used for malicious purposes.

- **Responsibility:** Use this script responsibly, and do not use it to harm or compromise the security of networks, devices, or data.

ARP spoofing is a significant cybersecurity concern, and network administrators should proactively protect their networks against such attacks.
