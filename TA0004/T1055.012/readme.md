# Process Memory Manipulation Script

This Go script allows you to perform various memory manipulation operations on a target Windows process. It uses Windows API functions to suspend, rewrite, and execute code within the target process's memory. This can be useful for various debugging and security analysis tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Go installed on your system.
- A target Windows process that you want to manipulate.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the Go script:

```bash
go run main.go
```

3. The script will connect to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service and monitor the creation of new processes.

4. When a new process is created, the script will prompt you with the following options:

- **Suspend the Process**: You can choose to suspend the newly created process.

- **Rewrite the Process Memory with NOP Instructions**: You can choose to replace the process's memory with NOP (No-Operation) instructions.

- **Append NOP Instructions to the Process Memory**: You can choose to append NOP instructions to the process's memory.

- **Append Code Page from File**: You can choose to append a code page from a file to the process's memory. This is useful for injecting custom code.

- **Resume the Process**: If you suspended the process earlier, you can choose to resume it.

- **Execute the New Code Page**: If you appended a code page from a file, you can choose to execute it within the target process.

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the desired operations.

## Important Notes

- Be cautious when using this script, as it allows you to manipulate the memory of other processes, which can have unintended consequences.

- Use this script responsibly and only on processes that you have permission to manipulate.

- Make sure to have appropriate antivirus and security measures in place, as such memory manipulation techniques can be flagged as suspicious behavior.

- The script provides options for suspending, rewriting, and executing code within a target process's memory. Exercise caution and ensure that you understand the implications of these actions.
